# Park: The Game!
Welcome to Park: The Game! This was a collaborative effort among Sophie Rehrig, Samantha Kacir, Nora Broderick, and Clare Allsopp-Shiner.

Compilation Instructions: make

Run Instructions: ./game

Problems:
* remembering parentheses
* loadsave doesn't work
* INVENTORIES
* circular dependencies
* inheritance
* destructors - esp. virtual
* some talk functions require uppercase
* using keys and items
* linking rooms with keys

Next Steps:
* make save and loadsave work
* add more items and interactions
* possibly add graphical interaction
* making it so that interacting with the same person over and over again doesn't keep giving motivation
